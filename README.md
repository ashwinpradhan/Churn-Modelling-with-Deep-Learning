# Churn-Modelling-with-Deep-Learning
The data set contains details of a bank's customers and the target variable is a binary variable reflecting the fact whether the customer left the bank (closed his account) or he continues to be a customer.
Predicting whether customers will close his account or not, by applying deep learning artificial neural network algorithms and Hyper-parameter tuning.
